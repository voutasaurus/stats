stats
=====

This is a library of statistical functions that I plan to add to over time as I feel the need to. As it stands there are probably a few actually useful statistics libraries for go (I haven't done a detailed survey, except to say that there's not one in the standard libraries), but most of the time I find it easier and more fun to write stuff myself, especially since I currently don't have very demanding requirements in terms of functionality and performance. Maybe eventually this library will have enough good stuff in it that it's worth actually looking at, but more likely for serious stuff it's easier to just wrangle data with go into a format that is usable by an R/Matlab/octave/Julia program, or use another stats library for go.
